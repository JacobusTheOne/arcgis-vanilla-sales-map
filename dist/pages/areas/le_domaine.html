      With the original developer plots practically sold out, these new plots
      are the first to be released in 7 years. And as land prices are on the
      increase, this is the perfect opportunity for buyers who are looking to
      invest as well as design and build their dream home. The new plots are in
      close proximity to the iconic Polo Pavilion and the new sports centre, The
      Yard, which will include a multi-purpose 1 000m2 gym, additional tennis
      courts, a 50m outdoor pool, soccer court and youth recreational areas.
